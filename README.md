## Les Bonnes Choses, JavaScript with NodeJS

This is a example project made by the prismic.io team as a showcase to help developers get started. By default, it consumes the content repository available at [https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api](https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api).

You can also visit the public version hosted at [http://lesbonneschoses.prismic.me](http://lesbonneschoses.prismic.me).

### Get started

This project gets started and installed exactly like the FRAMEWORK starter project, you will find all information [in its README file](https://github.com/prismicio/javascript-nodejs-starter/blob/master/README.md).

#### Connect it to your own Les Bonnes Choses repository

First, create your own Les Bonnes Choses content repository if you haven't: from your [prismic.io dashboard](https://prismic.io/dashboard/), click on the "Fork it now!" button in the "Fork the Les Bonnes Choses repository" frame.

Then, configure the project as described in the "Configure" paragraph of [the starter project's README file](https://github.com/prismicio/javascript-nodejs-starter/blob/master/README.md).

Now, you can change content in your EXAMPLE repository, and it will reflect in your local project.
